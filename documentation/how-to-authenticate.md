## Special number
Unfortunately this number is different for everyone and you can't upload any images without this.
 
To get this number you need to:
1. Open [Google Photos](https://photos.google.com/);
2. Open the Developer Tools of your Browser;
3. Go to the network tab and enable the filter to show only XHR requests;
4. Refresh the page;
5. Get the content response for the second XHR request. It should be a JavaScript file;
6. Find the declaration of the variable 'U7b' and find a number of 9 characters;
